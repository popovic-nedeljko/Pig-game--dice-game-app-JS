#### Code overview

The Dice game's user interface was built using JavaScript and DOM manipulation, allowing for dynamic updating of scores and game status as players roll the dice and accumulate points.

Through the use of conditional statements, loops, and event listeners, the dice game provides an engaging and interactive experience for two players, with the ability to customize the winning score and start a new game with the click of a button.

The use of a random number generator simulates rolling dice in the game, with a 6-6 roll resulting in the loss of all accumulated points for the active player.

The remaining features include logic for switching players, displaying scores, and determining a winner based on a chosen score threshold.
